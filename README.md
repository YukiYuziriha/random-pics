## how to run shit in dev mode: 
```

```

```
bun run build:watch
```
## what even is this?
that's image player/randomizer/slideshow app that is supposed to be my own version of gesturedrawing! app. 
## usecase
gesture drawing, times reference slideshow.
## why its good?
will be highly optimized, never choking on filesystem, freezing etc.

## current state
can randomly serve pictures. 
no timer yet, can load next/prev image in random/normal order. history of random preserves during session.
